# waste_management_system
 The Smart Waste Management System project aims to revolutionize waste management practices in India by leveraging surveillance cameras and machine learning technologies. The system will monitor dustbins in real-time, detecting fill levels through image processing. Full dustbins will be automatically locked, and notifications will be sent to cleaning teams for timely action. A web application will be developed to provide the public with real-time information on dustbin locations and statuses, promoting responsible waste disposal and enhancing urban cleanliness. This project seeks to address challenges in waste management, improve public hygiene, and foster a cleaner environment through innovative technology integration.
